#Neural Network in R

The objective of this project is to learn how to do a Neural Network. The objective is to generate a random
dataset with the datagenerator file provided in the course, and with this dataset, build a supervised learning Neural 
Network that takes 4 variables as an input and predicts the output we are given. In this scenario, with the help of the 
Neuralnet package, it was possible to build this Neural Network which is able to predict with an accuracy of 100% and a 
confidence interval of 95%
