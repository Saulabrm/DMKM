#Support Vector Machine in Python

##Summary
The purpose of this project is to implement and solve a `Support Vector Machine` (svm), with a dataset provided in order to correctly classify our dataset into two different classes. In order to accomplish this, we will consider $m$ points of $\mathbb{R}^n$, represented by the matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{mxn}$.
